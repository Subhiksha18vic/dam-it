**Project Name**: DAM(Digital Asset Managment) It

** Get closer to managing your digital assets by 'DAMing it in a single click'**

**Problem it solved:** 
Most Brands have their own whitelabel branding page with brand guidelines and assets for download. From looking for lost logos to customize them following the brand guidelines, it is arduous to have and track them all under one roof. Although there are few DAM softwares, we wanted to provide a solution where each digital brand will be treated as an digital asset through NFT by centralizing them in a decentralized way. We felt the need to have a Proof of Brand concept.

**What it does:**
Essentially brandapp acts as a onestop solution to mint your brand as an NFT. Your Brand's assets are uploaded to the IPFS via web3.Storae tool which persists and pins the files on the FileCoin Network. We also feature a public brands page where you find brand assets for all the brands minted on our dapp. Additionally, it paves the way for creative martech allowing you to view other brand's templates. Just connect your metamask wallet and start using the dapp. Brandapp is truly decentalized by enabling the features through the following technologies.

**How we built it**
The platform is built using ReactJS, IPFS~Filecoin and Solidity.The app uses a Bootstrap UI design system. We chose the Polygon network for its unparalelled scalability and cheap gas fees. Organizations that need a platform for branding documents can add their guidelines in this platform by connecting their metamask wallets. Once logged in, they can create and view brand guidelines. On creating brand guidelines all the metadata is stored in IPFS via Filecoin using Web3Storage. The NFT smart contract takes care of data upload and is unique as each data is non-fungible.
